# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)
 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?

    We started by brainstorming ideas of potential games and really liked the shopping mall idea. We then brainstormed elements that would make up the shopping mall such as the stores, employees, navigating the shopping mall, etc. 
    We then listed which tasks would be taken on by whom and tried to work on them separately. If any of us had questions or ideas, we would either message in the slack or bring them up during our weekly meetings. 
    For the design justification, we mainly tried to make it as object-oriented as possible and focused on implementing the core features (the stores and the purchasing game loop). We included the employee so that the user wouldn't be directly interacting with the store's stock and it also helped with making the interface more smooth. 

 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?

    I (Michelle) had never used switch statements in Java before to this extent and they were very useful in writing the game loops. We had also never written a full game out in Java before and the process was very different, as well I had never really worked in collaboration with someone on a game before so this was a totally new experience as well. I learned how to interact with a user fully as well as implement error catching on a wider scale.

 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?

    I wish the hunger system was more complex and perhaps had more features, as well there were many other good ideas that we wanted to implement but simply didn't have the time to do so. 

 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

    Additional features we considered were implementing different user types (ie different genders, families, ages, etc) which would have different effects, for example a family member would have to stay with their other members. We also considered having bathrooms and elevators/escalators and similar to the hunger meter having a bathroom meter. As well, we would have emergencies such as fires which would only allow escalators to be used. 

 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

    Definitely the advice that was emphasized in class to just make a working product instead of trying to do all these additional features. Focusing on the minimal viable product really helped with maximizing time so that we could at least have something before the assignment deadline. 

 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?

    I would say start early and make sure to communicate exactly how you want the different classes to interact. I would also say to draw up the architecture diagram earlier because I feel like that really helped with determining what we needed and what was optional. 

 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.

    I think working in a team really lightened the workload, however we did have some trouble with committing the work with github so I would've liked some more in-class support with that.
